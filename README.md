# WineOisseur
Design a wine search app that will help users to decide what type of wine to buy and where to purchase the bottle.  The user is able to search by region, user rating, varietal and price range.  They will be able to read reviews by other users, what food pairings go with that particular bottle of wine and details about the winery that produced that bottle.  They will be able to save there favorite bottles of wine into a sqlite database.  They will also be able to find wine stores located in there current location.
